# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 12/20/2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Mock Locations (“the app”) handles user information. Your privacy is important to us, and this app is designed to function without collecting or storing personal data.

---

## Information Collection and Use
**Mock Locations does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data.**

Specifically:
- The app does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or identifiers.
- The app does not track location data externally.
- Any location data used by the app is generated locally on the device solely for mock/testing purposes.

All mock location data remains on the user’s device and is never transmitted off the device.

---

## Location Data
The app uses location permissions only to provide mock location functionality as explicitly initiated by the user.

- Location access is required solely to simulate GPS coordinates for testing purposes.
- The app does not record, log, store, or share location data.
- The app does not access real GPS data unless the user explicitly enables it.

---

## Third-Party Services
**Mock Locations does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking services.**

No data is shared with third parties.

---

## Data Security
Because the app does not collect or store user data, there is no risk of personal data exposure through the app.

---

## Children’s Privacy
This app does not target children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
